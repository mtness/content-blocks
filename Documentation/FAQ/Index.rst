    ..  accordion-item:: What are Page Types for and how can I use them?
        :name: heading5

        properties that are just perfect for your needs.

        Example use case:

        .. code:: yaml

          name: example/blog
          typeName: 1582290360
          fields:
            - identifier: additional_field
              type: Text

        Your custom Page Type will be shown inside TYPO3's page section.
